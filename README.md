An Omarchy theme featuring Ruby language references, heavily inspired in [ashen neovim theme](https://github.com/ficd0/ashen.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#extras).
There is a blue version: [bluedotrb](https://github.com/dotsilva/omarchy-bluedotrb-theme).

# Install

```

```

# Featuring

Comfortable, but not excessive borders and border radius to increase screen use efficiency.
Red, orange, oil blue, dark gray and light gray color palette.

# Extras

You can install the waybar that is in the preview [here, its the 1.5 version](https://github.com/adsovetzky/Adsovetzky-Omarchy-s-Waybar).
